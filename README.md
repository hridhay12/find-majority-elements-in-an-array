# find-majority-elements-in-an-array
Efficiently identifies the majority element in an array — the value that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times. Uses the Moore’s Voting Algorithm, a two-step process that first selects a candidate and then verifies it. This project is perfect for mastering fundamental algorithm concepts and preparing for coding interviews.
